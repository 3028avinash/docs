Here, you will learn how to connect your application to a Redis database. If you're new to Redis, you might first want to [install Redis with Redis Stack and RedisInsight]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/" >}}).

For more Redis topics, see [Using]({{< relref "/develop/use/" >}}) and [Managing]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/management/" >}}) Redis.

If you're ready to get started, see the following guides for the official client libraries you can use with Redis. For a complete list of community-driven clients, see [Clients](/resources/clients/).


## High-level client libraries

The Redis OM client libraries let you use the document modeling, indexing, and querying capabilities of Redis Stack much like the way you'd use an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping). The following Redis OM libraries support Redis Stack:

* [Redis OM .NET]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-dotnet" >}})
* [Redis OM Node]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-node" >}})
* [Redis OM Python]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-python" >}})
* [Redis OM Spring]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-spring" >}})
