Use the pages in this section to start working with Redis right away.

The Quickstart tutorials provide a good way to see how Redis can
handle some common use cases:

- As a [data store]({{< relref "/develop/get-started/data-store" >}})
- As a [document database]({{< relref "/develop/get-started/document-database" >}})
- As a [vector database]({{< relref "/develop/get-started/vector-database" >}})
- For [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]({{< relref "/develop/get-started/rag" >}})

There is also an [FAQ]({{< relref "/develop/quickstart/faq" >}}) that answers
some of the most common questions users ask about Redis.
