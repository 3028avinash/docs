- Select the **Overview** tab to view and edit subscription details.

The following sections provide more details.

## Upgrade subscription plan

Use the **Upgrade plan** button to update your Fixed subscription tier, your high availability settings, or your payment method.

{{<image filename="images/rc/button-subscription-upgrade-plan.png" alt="Use the Upgrade plan button to change selected Fixed subscription detils." >}}

For information on how to upgrade to a Flexible subscription, see [upgrade subscription plan from Fixed to Flexible]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/upgrade-fixed-flexible" >}}).

### Change subscription tier

To change your subscription tier, select the desired tier from the list and select the **Upgrade plan** button:

{{<image filename="images/rc/subscription-change-fixed-tiers.png" width="100%" alt="Select the desired subscription tier from the ones shown." >}}

Each tier in a Fixed plan provides a variety of benefits, including increased memory and number of connections.
For a comparison of available tiers, see [Fixed plan subscription tiers]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/create-fixed-subscription.md#fixed-plan-subscription-tiers" >}}).

When you change your plan tier, your data and endpoints are not disrupted.  

If you upgrade a free plan to a paid tier, you need to add a payment method.

If you change your subscription to a lower tier, make sure your data fits within the limits of the new tier; otherwise, the change attempt will fail.

### Change high availability

To change your plan's high availability settings, select the desired setting in the **High availability** panel.

{{<image filename="images/rc/subscription-fixed-high-availability-panel.png" alt="Use the High availability panel to set Fixed subscription replication settings." >}}

Fixed plans support either no replication or single-zone replication.

Free tiers do not support replication.

### Change payment method

To change your subscription payment method, update the **Credit card** settings.  You can select a known payment method from the drop-down list or use the **Add** button to add a new one.

{{<image filename="images/rc/subscription-change-credit-card.png" alt="Use the Credit card drop-down to set your subscription payment method." >}}

Payment method changes require the Owner role.  If your sign-on is not a subscription owner, you cannot change the payment method.

To verify your role, select **Access Management** from the admin menu and then locate your credentials in the **Team** tab.

### Save changes

Use the **Upgrade plan** button to save changes.
