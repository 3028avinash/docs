## New features

### Nano billing unit

We added a Nano billing unit for Pro databases with a max. size of 500GB and max. throughput of 5K ops/sec. Use it to create smaller databases for a lower cost.

## Enhancements

### Search and query throughput in ops/sec

You can now set the throughput for databases with Search and query in operations per second (ops/sec), like all other Redis databases. This will let you seamlessly scale your query workload in and out as needed. 

## Deprecations

- Setting throughput by `number-of-shards` is now deprecated for the `POST /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/databases` REST API endpoint and will be removed soon. We recommend changing the throughput measurement to `operations-per-second` when you create databases using the Redis Cloud API.
