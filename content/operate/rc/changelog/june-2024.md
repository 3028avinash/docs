## Deprecations

### End of Triggers and Functions preview

Redis has discontinued the "Triggers and Functions" preview feature. You are no longer able to create a database with Triggers and Functions.  

- Commands such as TFCALL, TFCALLASYNC, and TFUNCTION are now deprecated and will return error messages upon execution.
- Any JavaScript functions stored in Redis will be automatically removed, and JavaScript-based triggers will be disabled.
- Lua functions and scripts will remain unaffected by this change.
