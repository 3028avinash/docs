## New features

### SAML domain verification

We added domain verification to [SAML single sign-on]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso" >}}) to enhance security. Before you set up SAML in Redis Cloud, you must first [verify domain ownership]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso#verify-domain" >}}) for any domains associated with your SAML setup.

You can now also associate multiple domains with your SAML setup.
