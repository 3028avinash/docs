## New features

### Active-Active Search and query support

[Active-Active databases]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/active-active-redis" >}}) on Redis Cloud now support [Search and query]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search" >}}). 

See [Create an Active-Active database]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-active-active-database" >}}) to learn how to create an Active-Active database.

See [Search and query Active-Active databases]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/search-active-active" >}}) to learn how to use Search and query on Active-Active databases.

## Enhancements

### Dataset size

We now distinguish between Dataset size and Memory limit to reduce confusion.

For Redis Cloud Essentials, the plan size refers to the full memory limit, not the dataset size. If you select high availability for an Essentials database, your dataset size will be half of the plan size. Both the total memory limit and dataset size are listed under **Database details** when you create an Essentials database.

For Redis Cloud Pro, you define your dataset size when you create the database, and we calculate your total memory limit automatically based on the features you choose.

See [Dataset size]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/clustering#dataset-size" >}}) for more information.
