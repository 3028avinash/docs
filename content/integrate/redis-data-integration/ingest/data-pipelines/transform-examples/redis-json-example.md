linkTitle: Write to a Redis JSON document
summary: Redis Data Integration keeps Redis in sync with the primary database in near
  real time.

{{<note>}}
RedisJSON module must be enabled in the target Redis database to be able to use this feature.
{{</note>}}

In the example below, the data is captured from the source table named `invoice` and is written to the Redis database as a JSON document. The connection is an optional parameter that must refer to the corresponding connection name defined in `config.yaml`. When the `data_type` parameter is specified for the job, it overrides the system-wide setting `target_data_type` defined in `config.yaml`. 

The additional optional parameter `on_update` can specify the writing strategy (`replace`, the default, or `merge`). This will affect how the document is written to the target. Replacing the document will overwrite it completely, while merging will update it with the fields captured in the source, keeping any the rest of the document intact. `replace` is usually more performant, while `merge` allows other jobs and applications to set extra fields in the same JSON documents. 

In this case, the results will be Redis JSON documents with key names based on the key expression (e.g. `invoice_id:1`) and with an expiration of 100 seconds. If no `expire` parameter is given, the keys will never expire.    

```yaml
source:
  server_name: chinook
  schema: public
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: json
      key:
        expression: concat(['invoice_id:', InvoiceId])
        language: jmespath
      on_update: replace        
      expire: 100
```
