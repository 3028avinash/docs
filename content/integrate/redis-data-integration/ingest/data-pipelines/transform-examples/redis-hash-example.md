linkTitle: Write to a Redis hash
summary: Redis Data Integration keeps Redis in sync with the primary database in near
  real time.
type: integration
weight: 30
---

In the following example, the data is captured from the source table named `invoice` and is written to the Redis database as hash keys. The connection is an optional parameter that must refer to the corresponding connection name defined in `config.yaml`. 
When the `data_type` parameter is specified for the job, it overrides the system-wide setting `target_data_type` defined in `config.yaml`. 

In this case, the results will be Redis hashes with key names based on the key expression (e.g., `invoice_id:1`) and with an expiration of 100 seconds.
If no `expire` parameter is given, the keys will never expire. 

```yaml
source:
  server_name: chinook
  schema: public
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: hash
      key:
        expression: concat(['invoice_id:', InvoiceId])
        language: jmespath
      expire: 100
```
